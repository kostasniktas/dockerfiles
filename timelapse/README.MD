# timelapse

A docker image to help me make some timelapses from JPG files.

## Assumptions

* They are JPG files in a flat directory structure
* I only want 1080p
* I don't care how `ffmpeg` handles images that aren't 16:9 (yet)
* 30 fps (for now)

## Usage

### Build container

```shell
$ docker build -t timelapse:latest .
```

### Running

You need an input folder and an output folder.  The image is designed to make copies of everything to reduce the change of destroying originals.  Should still make a copy first.

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) -v /path/to/input_images:/input -v /path/to/output_folder:/output timelapse:latest
```
